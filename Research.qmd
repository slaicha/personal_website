### Quantifying Wetland Carbon Emissions in the Southeastern United States

#### A Duke Bass Connections Team

#### Aug 2023 - May 2024

-   Implemented state of the art artificial neural networks for predicting regional-scale long-term CO2 flux data product for southeastern U.S. wetlands using TensorFlow and automatically tuned them with KerasTuner.
-   Processed historical and future spatially explicit data on climate and hydrology.
-   Generated monthly fine-gridded data products depicting both historical and future CO2 fluxes from wetlands in the Southeastern US.

### DKU Edge Intelligence Lab

#### Machine Leanring Summer Research Scholar

#### May - Aug 2023

-   Implemented sleep efficiency machine learning algorithms for FedCampus app, a health-related privacy-preserving application for the Duke Kunshan University campus. The data source is users' edge devices such as their smartwatches and mobile phones.
-   Trained the model in a federated learning setting to enhance privacy and implemented it using automated hyper-parameter tuning and timeseries forecasting techniques for accurate predictions.
